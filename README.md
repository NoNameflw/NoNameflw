I'm NoNameFtw from Scratch. I just run projects here because I for some reason literally cannot learn any text-based coding if I tried learning it for 1 year and not doing anything else (besides dying because of having no food). I might start coding here to make a hurricane sim or something if I find a breakthrough in learning some coding (as with what happened with Scratch), but that's a 1/100 chance.
